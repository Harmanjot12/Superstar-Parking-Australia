# Superstar-Parking-Australia


<p>The first program will allow the operator to enter the details for each car parked during the day, and save these details into a file named 'cars-parked-w.txt'. The entered details are the car plate number, the car entrance time in hours:minutes and the car exit time in hours:minutes. The program must use a loop that allows the operator to enter another car details. </p>
<br>
The program should also check the input for validity according to the following rules:

<ul>
<li>Car plate number must be an alpha numeric string of exactly six digits (e.g. ABC123).</li><br>
<li>Car entrance and exit times must be in the format hours:minutes and can take values from 00:00 to 23:59.</li><br>
<li>The exit time must be greater than the entrance time.</li><br>
</ul>
